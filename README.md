### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate backend developer with a solid foundation in banking and financial technology. I currently serve as an Application Manager at Access Bank Plc, where I manage ATM network systems, deploy critical software updates, and troubleshoot infrastructure issues to support 3,000+ terminals.

My journey into software engineering began with a curiosity for how things work behind the scenes. Working with banking applications exposed me to the complexities of backend systems, sparking a passion that led me to explore Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and MySQL.

### 🚀 My Vision
I aim to become a leading engineer building secure, scalable, and high-availability applications that power financial services and digital transformation in Africa and beyond.

### 💼 What I Love Working On
- Fintech applications
- Scalable RESTful APIs
- Automation tools for infrastructure management
- Real-time backend systems

### 💡 Fun Fact
I once led a team that restored banking services to a region-wide ATM outage—before lunch.
